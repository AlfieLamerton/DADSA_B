Task 1

MODULE 1
// Import the data into a data structure that you will create

import the file

create patient class
for each row in the csv file:
    create a patient object
    setting the appropriate attributes
    data stored!


MODULE 2
// Calculate the BMI for each patient and classify these patients as 
// underweight, normal, overweight, or obese
// Update the data structure adding the BMI

for each patient:
    do *calculate_bmi* // BMI = weight (kgs) / height**2 (m)
    save BMI attribute for patient

MODULE 3
// Print the patient name, age, BMI, and weight classification etc
// Show obese, then underweight, then overweight, then normal.
// Break every 10 ((if iterable is multiple of 10 add line break!))

for each patient: // This could be the same loop that calculates BMI (time?)
    { // Either:
    create display method(s) for the patient class and call it in main
    // OR:
    print the apt attributes in the main by calling them by name
    }
    if our iterable is multiple of 10 (modulo), insert line break


MODULE 4
// Print the worst 5 underweight and worst 5 obese patients in two 
// groupings, male and female

create datasets of all underweight and obese patients respectively
divide these datasets by sex
sort these 4 datasets
print the most underweight males and females
print the most obesee males and females
